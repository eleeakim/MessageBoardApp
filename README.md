# MessageBoardApp

This message board application is built using the Python Django web framework and uses a SQLite database to store message data. 
The application allows users to create new threads, reply to existing threads, and view all threads in the system. Users can 
also search for threads based on keywords or tags associated with the thread.

The application includes user authentication features that require users to create an account and log in to access the message 
board features. Users can also edit their profile information, such as their username and email address.

The message board data is stored in a SQLite database, which is a lightweight and easy-to-use database engine. The application 
includes models to represent the message board data, views to display the data, and templates to render the data to the user. 
The application also includes forms to allow users to submit new messages or replies.

To use the message board application, users can clone the GitHub repository and follow the instructions below to 
set up and run the application on their local machine. Users can also deploy the application to a web server to make it accessible to others.
